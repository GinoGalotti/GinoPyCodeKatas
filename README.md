#SeleniumPyCodeKatas
A learning repository where I'm going to push every small exercise and kata that I'm going to practice in order to gain some more expertise using Python.
Some of them are going to focus on a special factor of the language (such as lamba expressions, list comprenhension, etc.), other are just going to be tricky exercises to stay fit!
